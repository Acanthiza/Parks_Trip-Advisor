<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.1</span> Overall sentiment</h2>
<p>Using the tidytext package <span class="citation">(Robinson and Silge <a href="#ref-R-tidytext">2018</a>)</span>, the text within the character fields <code>Title</code> and <code>Review</code> were analysed. Some words were replaced with a synonym (Appendix Table <a href="appendix.html#tab:changeWords">9.1</a>). This includes ‘lumping’ words such as, say, <code>echidna</code> into <code>wildlife</code>. The following words were reclassified as neutral from negative sentiment as they were overwhelmingly not used in a negative manner: cave; challenging; cold; crashing; desert; dirt; downhill; falls; miss; remarkable; rocky; ruins; shady; steep; unbelievable; unexpected; unusual; wedge; and wild. The following words were removed from the analysis as they refer to park or place names, and occur frequently, but do not add much to the analysis: adelaide; arch; chase; coffin; coober; flinders; granite; gully; harbor; harbour; island; kangaroo; ki; lofty; morialta; mount; mt; national; park; pedy; pound; ranges; rocks; victor; and wilpena.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="word-analysis.html#fig:title">7.1</a> shows the ten most common positive, negative and neutral words given in the <code>Title</code> field. The presence of <code>worth</code> in this list suggested that reviewers thought that the positive sentiments they expressed came at a cost (perhaps time and/or distance). A random sample of contexts in which <code>worth</code> occured:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Worth the Long Travelling”</li>
<li>“Well worth the $”</li>
<li>Not well signposted but worth the visit</li>
<li>Worth every kilometre of bumpy road</li>
<li>“Worth a Long trip !”</li>
</ul>
<p>Figure <a href="word-analysis.html#fig:review">7.2</a> shows the ten most common positive, negative and neutral words given in the <code>Review</code> field. Again, the most frequently occuring words are positive or neutral. Also, <code>worth</code> occurs frequently again, but so does <code>easy</code>. A random sample of contexts in which <code>easy</code> occured:</p>
<ul>
<li>just a stone throw from the city. a short walk from the car park to the waterfall, nice and easy. blackberries still on the bushes..enjoyed my short walk.</li>
<li>I went with a friend to Morialta Falls on a Sunday afternoon to see them after a lot of rain this winter. The easy (short and gentle) walk is to the base of the first falls, but if you want a more strenuous walk/climb, you can take the paths to the other falls higher up. There are several parking areas along the road to the falls which get busy on the weekend (parking was free the day we went; not sure if it’s always free though). Keep going to the end carpark if you don’t want to walk too far, but you may have to wait a moment for another car to leave. There are toilets there at the end, and the day we were there, a food and drinks van as well. It’s a lovely spot for a walk, not too far from Adelaide city</li>
<li>Scenic walk across Victor Harbor to Granite Island on the bridge, we opted not to take the Horse Drawn Tram and was going to take it back but as it was full (school Group) we also walked back. The walk around the island allow 30-45 minutes and easy walk on tracks with great views. There are toilets and a cafe which opened at 12 but earlier on a weekend. Would recomend when visiting Victor Harbor.</li>
<li>Can be very cold, but it is a fresh and revitalising cold. Walked around the island and easy enough for all fitness levels</li>
<li>amazing place with views that you can only dream off for days after the visit..its very peaceful there…awesome spot for photos and just to chill. Heaps of car parking space and a very easy path to get to and from the rocks. defiantly go there!!</li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.2</span> By park sentiment</h2>
<p>Figure <a href="word-analysis.html#fig:parkTitle">7.3</a> shows, by park, the five most common positive, negative and neutral words given in the <code>Title</code> field. The lowest frequency at which <code>nature</code> occurs is third. A random sample of contexts in which <code>nature</code> occurs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Escape to nature on the city’s edge</li>
<li>9to5explorer: unbelievable bushland and nature, just 30mins from CBD 5*</li>
<li>Connecting with nature</li>
<li>great leisurely walk with natural and manmade beauty–and a sunset miracle of nature-Shearwaters returning</li>
<li>“Perfect site for nature’s lovers”</li>
</ul>
<p>Figure <a href="word-analysis.html#fig:parkReview">7.4</a> shows, by park, the five most common positive, negative and neutral words given in the <code>Review</code> field. Each park had <code>hard</code> in the negative words, followed by <code>difficult</code> which occured in most parks. Some examples of the context in which <code>hard</code> occurs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Love this place hiked from here to mount lofty and back. Was a hard walk but amazing views just bring some water and sunscreen with you. There’s lots of places to sit and rest so you can keep on going.</li>
<li>It was windy and chilly on the day we were there, but I’m so glad we didn’t miss this place. First we walked the trails to look for platypus, but learned too late that they are very hard to find, and mostly seen at dawn and dusk. Then we went down the steps to see the seals. Very worthwhile walk. Last was the Remarkable Rocks. They are amazing! Don’t miss them!</li>
<li>We popped here for a quick Saturday afternoon walk, 1hr up/down part of the hill just to get some exercise and fresh air. For South Australia the main waterfall was looking good and in full fall (July) and is easily viewable from the main carpark or up closer with a 2 minute stroll from the carpark. BUT a carparking spot is always hard to get here (although it is free) - luckily we came at 4pm when a lot of people were leaving (open til 9pm). The toilets in the carpark were purposeful but smelly, and the Utopia cafe on the opposite side was closed for renovations (but opening again - 1st August 2014). We have previously done the full hike up to Mt Lofty peak - a good uphill workout for a relatively fit family.</li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.3</span> Activities</h2>
<p>Figure <a href="word-analysis.html#fig:reviewActivity">7.5</a> shows how frequently various activities were mentioned in the <code>Review</code> field. This information is essentially the same as in Figure <a href="word-analysis.html#fig:review">7.2</a> but with a focus only on activities.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="word-analysis.html#fig:parkActivity">7.6</a> shows the frequency with which activities are mentioned in the <code>Review</code> field for the most reviewed parks. Often reviewers mention things done outside the park in their reviews. For example, the reviews for Granite Island that mentioned camping gave lots of information about the area around that park:</p>
<ul>
<li>We had initially been disappointed to find out that the penguin population was so small that we wouldn’t be able to see any, but decided to visit the Island anyways. We enjoyed our stroll and the cool granite structures. Our favourite part of visiting Victor Harbour was the hike up the Bluffs and then along the Petrol Cove Path. We spent the night camping in Waitpinga and that was our highlight of the trip. The beach was amazing and so was the hike along the Heysen Trail. We’d strongly advise anyone visiting this area to include some of these bush walks in their visit and next time we go back we’d take more time to do more of this</li>
<li>Victor Harbour and the Fleurieu Peninsula. Victor Harbor is situated approx 80kms south of Adelaide, the drive takes around 80 minutes depending whether you want to stop at Mclaren Valley. We stayed at the Whalers Inn situated just on the outskirts of Victor Harbor. (Read review) and had all intentions of visiting Kangaroo Island. What is amazing about this area is the huge diversity of landscapes and attractions, which can cause a deviation or detour from your original itinerary. Hence, we never got to see Kangaroo Island, as we found the whole region of the Fleurieu Peninsula absolutely fascinating, stunning and spectacular with dramatic scenery. The natural wilderness mixed with pristine rugged coastline and beaches, truly makes this region Australia’s best natural asset. Victor Harbor is nestled by the sea, with lovely colonial heritage buildings and sites. The town is very quaint with some great old Australian pubs and Inns. There are plenty of restaurants, cafes and shops to keep you entertained. You can take a Heritage walking trial tour and learn the history of buildings like the Old Custom and Stationmaster house. The best thing to do is walk across or catch the horse-drawn wagon across to Granite Island and see the colony of little penguins. The best time to see the penguins is in the early evening around 7pm, as the penguins return home from sea to feed their chicks. (Make sure you take some warm clothes, it…Victor Harbour and the Fleurieu Peninsula.

The best time to see the penguins is in the early evening around 7pm, as the penguins return home from sea to feed their chicks. (Make sure you take some warm clothes, it can get very chilly with the sea winds.) If thinking of staying at Cape Jervis before heading to Kangaroo Island then disregard this idea. Victor Harbour is a lovely seaside town and far more appealing and interesting; Whaler’s Inn is approx 30 minutes drive away from Cape Jervis and a far better choice to be positioned. What to do: Walk across to Granite Island and see the penguins at dusk. Visit the towns of Goolwa, Port Elliot, Hindmarsh Island, and Coorong National Park and see the Murray River Mouth. For some awesome scenery take a walk on the “Heysen Trail” which can be connected to just past the Bluff or at Parsons beach or Newland Headlands.(A must do). You can walk this track to Cape Jervis but it takes a couple of days, camping areas are available for keen bushwalkers. Another walk is from Victor Harbor to Port Elliot along the beach. (7kms). All maps can be obtained at the Information Centre. Follow all the tourist brown signs and get lost in the beauty exploring this gorgeous region. From Cape Jervis drive the coastal road back to Adelaide and see some lovely seaside towns. More</li>
