<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.1</span> Overall sentiment</h2>
<p>Using the tidytext package <span class="citation">(Robinson and Silge <a href="#ref-R-tidytext">2018</a>)</span>, the text within the character fields <code>Title</code> and <code>Review</code> were analysed. Some words were replaced with a synonym (Appendix Table <a href="appendix.html#tab:changeWords">9.1</a>). This includes ‘lumping’ words such as, say, <code>echidna</code> into <code>wildlife</code>. The following words were reclassified as neutral from negative sentiment as they were overwhelmingly not used in a negative manner: cave; challenging; cold; crashing; desert; dirt; downhill; falls; miss; remarkable; rocky; ruins; shady; steep; unbelievable; unexpected; unusual; wedge; and wild. The following words were removed from the analysis as they refer to park or place names, and occur frequently, but do not add much to the analysis: adelaide; arch; chase; coffin; coober; flinders; granite; gully; harbor; harbour; island; kangaroo; ki; lofty; morialta; mount; mt; national; park; pedy; pound; ranges; rocks; victor; and wilpena.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="word-analysis.html#fig:title">7.1</a> shows the ten most common positive, negative and neutral words given in the <code>Title</code> field. The presence of <code>worth</code> in this list suggested that reviewers thought that the positive sentiments they expressed came at a cost (perhaps time and/or distance). A random sample of contexts in which <code>worth</code> occured:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Well Worth a Visit”</li>
<li>Worth the trip to Flinders!</li>
<li>“Well worth seeing”</li>
<li>“Worth the trip”</li>
<li>Worth a Visit</li>
</ul>
<p>Figure <a href="word-analysis.html#fig:review">7.2</a> shows the ten most common positive, negative and neutral words given in the <code>Review</code> field. Again, the most frequently occuring words are positive or neutral. Also, <code>worth</code> occurs frequently again, but so does <code>easy</code>. A random sample of contexts in which <code>easy</code> occured:</p>
<ul>
<li>The roads here a very well maintained, and cleared regularly. The park café was friendly and well-stocked. A fabulous coffee set us off on our journey. The sights of Admiral’s Arch and Remarkable Rocks are simply awesome. Set up well for easy access.</li>
<li>Waterfall Gully is a beautiful place and also very popular. It was really difficult to find a parking space on a Sunday morning. It was an easy walk to the waterfall. It is a beautiful sight. Good place to start a hike too. Surprisingly fast to get to by car, no good connections by public transportation though.</li>
<li>These challenging and well maintained mountain bike trails were a great discovery! As a novice I found these trails tough going but well worth the effort. They start at an intermediate level. For easy trails you need to head down to the nearby Melrose Showgrounds. The local bike shop is simply brilliant and provides quality bike hire, gear, maps and even coffee!</li>
<li>good short and longer walks ranging from easy to moderate/hard. great views and waterfalls in winter</li>
<li>Let me start by saying the flinders rangers are beautiful, I have visited the area a few times and love the views. This was my 1st time visiting Wilpena pound via the visitor centre at the resort. We were keen to do a walk and check the views of the pound. I asked at the visitor centre how long are the walks, I ask as I have a child still recovering his strength from chemotherapy treatment (I did not disclose that). I was told it is an easy 2km walk to the pound. That was achievable, however the more I read the information signs along the way the walk was much longer, about a 6.6km return. It is 2km walk to the entrance of the pound, then onwards. We made it to the Homestead look out, and in the words of my son, it was not worth the walk. I take responsibility for not doing my homework on the distances, however I would have thought that information would have been made clear when I asked. If you love your bush walks and hikes, there are heaps here to do.</li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.2</span> By park sentiment</h2>
<p>Figure <a href="word-analysis.html#fig:parkTitle">7.3</a> shows, by park, the five most common positive, negative and neutral words given in the <code>Title</code> field. The lowest frequency at which <code>nature</code> occurs is third. A random sample of contexts in which <code>nature</code> occurs:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Wonderful glimpse into rugged South Australian nature”</li>
<li>“Mother nature at her best”</li>
<li>great leisurely walk with natural and manmade beauty–and a sunset miracle of nature-Shearwaters returning</li>
<li>“Good hikes and nature”</li>
<li>A piece of nature near the city that is worth the hike</li>
</ul>
<p>Figure <a href="word-analysis.html#fig:parkReview">7.4</a> shows, by park, the five most common positive, negative and neutral words given in the <code>Review</code> field. Each park had <code>hard</code> in the negative words, followed by <code>difficult</code> which occured in most parks. Some examples of the context in which <code>hard</code> occurs:</p>
<ul>
<li>long drive from the centre of Kingscote but well worth the effort with many other attractions close by such as lighthouse, National park and beaches. The parking is good and the short walk not hard. an amazing place that is really popular but people sort of get absorbed into the surroundings.</li>
<li>Great place to go for a walk, have a coffee and enjoy fresh air, no fee to pay to get in but it is a little bit hard to get parking so be patient.</li>
<li>We went there on Friday after lunch , car park was ok but on the week end I can’t imagine how hard it would be to find a place. Anyway , you just can walk ( hard walk but so nice ) to mount lofty , around 4km but you have different way to go there , and even if you don’t want walk so far just walk 500m up to see the waterfall and you can also go on a top ( 5mins walk). Just get a cold water bottle and good shoes :)</li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.3</span> Activities</h2>
<p>Figure <a href="word-analysis.html#fig:reviewActivity">7.5</a> shows how frequently various activities were mentioned in the <code>Review</code> field. This information is essentially the same as in Figure <a href="word-analysis.html#fig:review">7.2</a> but with a focus only on activities.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="word-analysis.html#fig:parkActivity">7.6</a> shows the frequency with which activities are mentioned in the <code>Review</code> field for the most reviewed parks. Often reviewers mention things done outside the park in their reviews. For example, the reviews for Granite Island that mentioned camping gave lots of information about the area around that park:</p>
<ul>
<li>We had initially been disappointed to find out that the penguin population was so small that we wouldn’t be able to see any, but decided to visit the Island anyways. We enjoyed our stroll and the cool granite structures. Our favourite part of visiting Victor Harbour was the hike up the Bluffs and then along the Petrol Cove Path. We spent the night camping in Waitpinga and that was our highlight of the trip. The beach was amazing and so was the hike along the Heysen Trail. We’d strongly advise anyone visiting this area to include some of these bush walks in their visit and next time we go back we’d take more time to do more of this</li>
<li>Victor Harbour and the Fleurieu Peninsula. Victor Harbor is situated approx 80kms south of Adelaide, the drive takes around 80 minutes depending whether you want to stop at Mclaren Valley. We stayed at the Whalers Inn situated just on the outskirts of Victor Harbor. (Read review) and had all intentions of visiting Kangaroo Island. What is amazing about this area is the huge diversity of landscapes and attractions, which can cause a deviation or detour from your original itinerary. Hence, we never got to see Kangaroo Island, as we found the whole region of the Fleurieu Peninsula absolutely fascinating, stunning and spectacular with dramatic scenery. The natural wilderness mixed with pristine rugged coastline and beaches, truly makes this region Australia’s best natural asset. Victor Harbor is nestled by the sea, with lovely colonial heritage buildings and sites. The town is very quaint with some great old Australian pubs and Inns. There are plenty of restaurants, cafes and shops to keep you entertained. You can take a Heritage walking trial tour and learn the history of buildings like the Old Custom and Stationmaster house. The best thing to do is walk across or catch the horse-drawn wagon across to Granite Island and see the colony of little penguins. The best time to see the penguins is in the early evening around 7pm, as the penguins return home from sea to feed their chicks. (Make sure you take some warm clothes, it…Victor Harbour and the Fleurieu Peninsula.

The best time to see the penguins is in the early evening around 7pm, as the penguins return home from sea to feed their chicks. (Make sure you take some warm clothes, it can get very chilly with the sea winds.) If thinking of staying at Cape Jervis before heading to Kangaroo Island then disregard this idea. Victor Harbour is a lovely seaside town and far more appealing and interesting; Whaler’s Inn is approx 30 minutes drive away from Cape Jervis and a far better choice to be positioned. What to do: Walk across to Granite Island and see the penguins at dusk. Visit the towns of Goolwa, Port Elliot, Hindmarsh Island, and Coorong National Park and see the Murray River Mouth. For some awesome scenery take a walk on the “Heysen Trail” which can be connected to just past the Bluff or at Parsons beach or Newland Headlands.(A must do). You can walk this track to Cape Jervis but it takes a couple of days, camping areas are available for keen bushwalkers. Another walk is from Victor Harbor to Port Elliot along the beach. (7kms). All maps can be obtained at the Information Centre. Follow all the tourist brown signs and get lost in the beauty exploring this gorgeous region. From Cape Jervis drive the coastal road back to Adelaide and see some lovely seaside towns. More</li>
