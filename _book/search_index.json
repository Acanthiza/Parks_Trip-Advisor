Some of these parks have a ‘page’ on TripAdvisor. For example, there is a page for Ikara-Flinders Ranges National Park. DEW are interested to know what information is contained in TripAdvisor reviews. Specifically, the following analyses were identified by the community engagement branch as potentially useful: data summary, including which parks were reviewed and by how many people word analysis: overall sentiment activities mentioned facilities mentioned wildlife mentioned Each of these to be investigated by three major groupings: South Australian reviewers Other Austrlian reviewers Overseas reviewers "],
["methods.html", "2 Methods 2.1 Data source 2.2 Workflow", " 2 Methods 2.1 Data source Data were taken from Trip Advisor. The site is one of the most popular sources of reviews for hotels, restaurants, experiences, attractions and places such as parks. Trip Advisor features user-generated content with 315 million reviewers (active and inactive) and about 500 million reviews Wikipedia. For the purposes of this analysis, the search function in Trip Advisor was used to identify all parks, reserves and features in parks and reserves that have been reviewed. Some reviews were captured under a park name, such as “Flinders Chase National Park” and some were captured under a feature name, such as “Flinders Chase Visitor Centre”. The web scraping software Octoparse was used to capture the following elements for analysis: Reviewer name Reviewer location (country, state and city) Reviewer age Reviewer gender Review date Review title Review text Review star rating Note that the web scraping software was able to effectively capture elements such as name, date, title, text and star rating, but that capturing the demographic information about the reviewers was a more difficult process. The demographic information is contained within “hover over” elements of the Trip Advisor web pages. Code was written to scrape these elements for the initial data scrape; manual cutting and pasting was used for scrape updates. It may be for this reason that most academic analysis of Trip Advisor reviews does not extend to considering demographic information and that this report may offer some new information about the utility of this data source. Once the data was captured it was cleaned so that it could be more easily used for qualitative analysis. The cleaning included: Ensuring that each review was attached to a unique reviewer name Standardising place names to ensure that spellings were correct Allocating state and/or countries to reviewers who gave only partial location information such as city of residence Ensuring that the data set contained no blank cells Removing reviewers under 18 years old (remove reviewers where the age field was equal to 13-17) A final step was removal of three parks considered outliers with respect to the rest of the dataset: Seal Bay Conservation Park Cleland Wildlife Park Adelaide Gaol Cleland and Seal Bay give people the opportunity to interact with, and even hold, wildlife - behaviour that is not encouraged in other parks; and Adelaide Gaol is an urban heritage site that has very different characteristics to parks. 2.2 Workflow This data analysis and report writing was done in a single scripted workflow (script file: Report.Rmd using the programs ‘R’ and ‘R-studio’. R (R Core Team 2019) is an open-source platform which makes available a library of packages that can be used and modified as necessary. R-studio provides a range of user-friendly features to facilitate interaction with R. The packages used are listed in the appendix: R packages used Table 9.8. All data, code and outputs are stored in a version control system at Parks_Trip-Advisor. References "],
["data-exploration.html", "3 Data exploration 3.1 Summary 3.2 Missing data 3.3 Count of reviews", " 3 Data exploration 3.1 Summary Between 16/May/2004 and 28/May/2019 there were 8111 reviews on TripAdvisor meeting the criteria outline in the methods. In total there were 50 Parks with reviews written by 5679 unique reviewers. The most reviews by any one reviewer was 17 by reviewer Steve W (giving an average of 4.5 stars [and a range between 4 and 5]). The park with the most reviews was Flinders Chase National Park with 2592 reviews, averaging 4.8 stars. One star reviews accounted for 0.5% of the reviews and five star reviews accounted for 80.1%. 3.2 Missing data Some of the key data fields were left blank in many reviews. For example, 3709 (46%) reviews did not provide their gender and 4292 (53%) didn’t provide their age. Figure 3.1 shows the percentage of reviews that did not provide information against each field. Figure 3.1: A large proportion of reviews did not answer some questions, particularly Gender and Age 3.3 Count of reviews There are several variables in the data with relatively few levels: Age; City; Country; Feature/location; Gender; id; Month; Origin; Park; reviews; Stars; State; StateCountry; Text; User; and Year. Figure 3.2 shows the most frequently occuring values in each of those variables. Figure 3.2: Most frequent values in each of the variables.

["words.html", "4 Words", " 4 Words Using the tidytext package (Robinson and Silge 2018), the text within the character fields Title and Review were analysed. Some words were replaced with a synonym (Appendix Table 9.1). This includes ‘lumping’ words such as, say, echidna into wildlife. The following words were reclassified as neutral from negative sentiment as they were overwhelmingly not used in a negative manner (e.g. Table 4.1): cave; cold; crashing; desert; dirt; downhill; falls; miss; remarkable; rocky; ruins; shady; unbelievable; unexpected; unusual; wedge; and wild. The following words were removed from the analysis as they refer to park or place names, and occur frequently, but do not add much to the analysis: adelaide; arch; chase; coffin; coober; flinders; granite; gully; harbor; harbour; island; kangaroo; ki; lofty; morialta; mount; mt; national; park; pedy; pound; ranges; review; rocks; title; victor; and wilpena. Figure 4.1 shows the ten most common positive, negative and neutral words given in the combined Title and Review fields. The most frequent word with positive sentiment was beautiful. A random sample of contexts in which beautiful occured: “Awesome and beautiful!!!” Ruggedly beautiful “Great ride with a beautiful view” “Breathtakingly beautiful” “beautiful place, stunning views” The most frequent word with neutral sentiment was nature. A random sample of contexts in which nature occured: “Great slice of nature” “See awe inspiring nature.” “Absolute nature” “Good hikes and nature” An amazing encounter with nature’s biggest The most frequent word with negative sentiments was steep. A random sample of contexts in which steep occurred: “Don’t take the path signposted”to steep gully\"” Great views…steep walk!! “Great Hiking and a lovely steep bit at the end -” A significant interaction was found between origin of reviewer and words used (Chi-squared = 237.7, df = 48, p &lt;= 0). This can be seen visually in Figure 4.2. The main contributions to the overall chi-squared value were: walk occurs more than expected in SA; challenging occurs more than expected in SA; and wildlife occurs more than expected in Overseas.

Privileged to see the whales in natural surroundings mandipixie 5 cave Title: Great Day Out - Review: We had a fabulous day at the caves. They are very interesting and beautiful. We did a couple of tours including the Fossil Cave this is seriously worth doing as they show a actual archaeology dig that they froze in time to share with the public by getting World Heritage status. Truly very interesting and our guide was an archaeologist so sharing her passion for the preservation of the caves and the history was infectious. Lots of families but be aware that the Fossil Cave may not suit toddlers as they are required to sit quietly for a significant time to hear about the history and the dig. Some people may sniff at the price of this particular tour but the funds go to preserving the park and paying the guides. Well worth it! lauryn138 4 cave Title: Stunning - Review: This cave was absolutely stunning from that WOW moment when the cave entrance was opened til the end when I finally walked out. So many different and beautiful formations to look at and the guide Jake was an absolute gem. A lot of fun very knowledgeable and interesting and those eyes!!!!
