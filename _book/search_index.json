Some of these parks have a ‘page’ on TripAdvisor. For example, there is a page for Ikara-Flinders Ranges National Park. DEW are interested to know what information is contained in TripAdvisor reviews. Specifically, the following questions were identified by the community engagement branch: Where are visitors from: Overall percentages – as in, of all the people who reviewed SA parks, 40 percent were Australian, 10 percent were English, 8 percent were American etc. By park percentages – as in, of all the people who reviewed Belair National Park, 40 percent were Australian, 10 percent were English, 8 percent were American etc. What gender are visitors: Overall percentages – as in, of all the people who reviewed SA parks, 45 percent were male and 55 percent were female By park percentages – as in, of all the people who reviewed Belair national park, 45 percent were male and 55 percent were female What ages are visitors? Overall By individual park When are reviews made? (As in, in which month is the quantity of reviews submitted to Trip Advisor the highest? In which month is the quantity of reviews submitted to Trip Advisor the lowest?) Overall By individual park How does seasonality affect park ratings? (As in, parks receive most positive ratings in December and most negative ratings in May) Overall By individual park Are males or females more likely to rate parks positively or negatively? Overall By individual park Which country/state is more likely to rate parks positively or negatively? Overall By individual park Which age is more likely to rate parks positively or negatively? Overall By individual park Other possible questions SA analysis – Adelaide vs regional views of parks Multiple park reviews from one user: Does reviewing more than one park lead to higher or lower ratings? What parks are visited by people who review more than one park? Can we get a sense of itinerary from international visitors? These questions were treated as the following: What is the effect of age and gender on the rating given? What is the effect of the park visited on the rating given? What is the effect of the origin of a reviewer on the rating given? These three analyses answer most of the questions posed by the community engagement branch. A further analysis of words used in the titles and reviews was also undertaken. "],
["data-exploration.html", "2 Data exploration 2.1 Summary 2.2 Missing data 2.3 Count of reviews", " 2 Data exploration 2.1 Summary Between 16/May/2004 and 02/November/2019 there were 3849 reviews on TripAdvisor that could be associated with South Australian parks. 2.2 Missing data Some of the key data fields were left blank in many reviews. For example, 1714 (45%) reviews did not provide their gender and 1987 (52%) didn’t provide their age. Figure 2.1 shows the percentage of reviews that did not provide information against each field. Figure 2.1: A large proportion of reviews did not answer some questions, particularly Gender and Age 2.3 Count of reviews There are several variables in the data with relatively few levels: Age; City; Country; Gender; id; Month; Park; Stars; State; User; and Year. Figure 2.2 shows the most frequently occuring values in each of those variables. Figure 2.2: Most frequent values in each of the variables. Most reviews are from Adelaide based 50-64 year olds called Charmaine who visit Flinders Chase in January "],

The analysis was run using the rstanarm package (Stan Development Team 2016) in R (R Core Team 2018). Month (of review), Park (visited by reviewer) and State (of origin of reviewer) were treated as random effects in the analysis. Each reviewer was then assumed to provide an independent data point for the analysis. A time field was generated as \\(time = min(Year) + (max(Year) - min(Year))/2\\). The model specification was: cbind(Y, 4 - Y) ~ Gender * Age * time + (1 | Month) + (1 | Park) + , (1 | State) where Y is Stars-1. 3.2 Model diagnostics Figure 3.1 shows that each of the chains used to estimate model parameters converged around similar values for each parameter. Figure 3.1: All chains converged around the same values for each of the model paramaters (first 10 shown here) Figure 3.2 provides further support for convergence of the chains as no values are markedly different to 1.0. Figure 3.2: Rhat values show no reason for concern Figure 3.3 shows how (a sample of) the model runs (in light blue) compare with the original data (shown in dark blue). Figure 3.3: The model runs under estimate four stars and over estimate three stars relative to the data Figure 3.4 shows how the mean and standard deviation of the model runs (in light blue) compare with that of the original data (in dark blue). Figure 3.4: Collectively the model runs do a reasonable job estimating the data 3.3 Model predictions In order to better understand how the data and resulting model are able to inform management, a number (4000) of simulations were made based on the model results (strictly, draws were made from the posterior predictive distribution). Each simulation generated a prediction based on a single draw of the model parameters from their predicted distributions. Table 3.1 shows a summary of these results. Table 3.1: Summary of model results Year Age Gender Mean Median and range in 90% credible intervals 2017 18-24 Male 3.65 4 (1 to 5) 2018 18-24 Female 4.76 5 (3 to 5) 2018 25-34 Female 4.81 5 (4 to 5) 2018 25-34 Male 4.74 5 (3.98 to 5) 2018 35-49 Female 4.65 5 (3 to 5) 2018 35-49 Male 4.63 5 (3 to 5) 2018 50-64 Female 4.64 5 (3 to 5) 2018 50-64 Male 4.64 5 (3 to 5) 2018 65+ Female 4.61 5 (3 to 5) 2018 65+ Male 4.48 5 (3 to 5) Figure 3.5 shows a plot of the model results. Overwhelmingly, reviewers give 5 stars, irrespective of age or gender. Figure 3.5: Model results - mean credible intervals. Most reviewers give 5 stars irrespective of age or gender. The lower 95% credible intervals go to three stars in almost every case - i.e. more than 95% of responses are three stars or more. Only for 18-24 year old males in 2015 do the 95% credible intervals go to 1 star References "],

California and the North Island of New Zealand both appear to have increased the stars they give in reviews through time, however the total number of reviews are low in each case so this result should be treated cautiously. There is very little trend in stars given by origin of reviewers for other origins References "],

Figure 6.1 shows the ten most common positive, negative and neutral words given in titles. Figure 6.2 shows the same for reviews. The following words were reclassified as neutral from negative sentiment as they were overwhelmingly not used in a negative manner: wild; desert; falls; unbelievable; unusual; unexpected; miss; challenging; remarkable; steep; cold; dirt; rocky; crashing; downhill; shady; ruins; cave; and wedge.
