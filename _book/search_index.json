Some of these parks have a ‘page’ on TripAdvisor. For example, there is a page for Ikara-Flinders Ranges National Park. DEW are interested to know what information is contained in TripAdvisor reviews. Specifically, the following questions were identified by the community engagement branch: Where are visitors from: Overall percentages – as in, of all the people who reviewed SA parks, 40 percent were Australian, 10 percent were English, 8 percent were American etc. By park percentages – as in, of all the people who reviewed Belair National Park, 40 percent were Australian, 10 percent were English, 8 percent were American etc. What gender are visitors: Overall percentages – as in, of all the people who reviewed SA parks, 45 percent were male and 55 percent were female By park percentages – as in, of all the people who reviewed Belair national park, 45 percent were male and 55 percent were female What ages are visitors? Overall By individual park When are reviews made? (As in, in which month is the quantity of reviews submitted to Trip Advisor the highest? In which month is the quantity of reviews submitted to Trip Advisor the lowest?) Overall By individual park How does seasonality affect park ratings? (As in, parks receive most positive ratings in December and most negative ratings in May) Overall By individual park Are males or females more likely to rate parks positively or negatively? Overall By individual park Which country/state is more likely to rate parks positively or negatively? Overall By individual park Which age is more likely to rate parks positively or negatively? Overall By individual park Other possible questions SA analysis – Adelaide vs regional views of parks Multiple park reviews from one user: Does reviewing more than one park lead to higher or lower ratings? What parks are visited by people who review more than one park? Can we get a sense of itinerary from international visitors? After an initial data exploration, these questions were treated as the following: What is the effect of age and gender on the rating given? What is the effect of the park visited on the rating given? What is the effect of the origin of a reviewer on the rating given? These three analyses answer most of the questions posed by the community engagement branch but do not always examine interations, such as, say, the interaction of age and park on stars. This was done as sample size was very small for some groups, especially for low stars. A further analysis of words used in the titles and reviews was also undertaken. "],
["methods.html", "2 Methods 2.1 Data source", " 2 Methods 2.1 Data source Data were taken from Trip Advisor. The site is one of the most popular sources of reviews for hotels, restaurants, experiences, attractions and places such as parks. Trip Advisor features user-generated content with 315 million reviewers (active and inactive) and about 500 million reviews Wikipedia. For the purposes of this analysis, the search function in Trip Advisor was used to identify all parks, reserves and features in parks and reserves that have been reviewed. Some reviews were captured under a park name, such as “Flinders Chase National Park” and some were captured under a feature name, such as “Flinders Chase Visitor Centre”. In order to manage the scope of this analysis it was decided to collect reviews in the first instance for parks that were reviewed under their official park names. Where there was a park that is of importance to DEW that had reviews under a feature name rather than a park name, these reviews were also collected. For example, reviews were collected for “Waterfall Gully” rather than for “Cleland Conservation Park”. In order to manage the scope of the analysis, and in reflection of DEW’s current organisational structure, it was also decided to limit the review collection to parks and reserves that are not “iconic sites”. DEW’s organisational structure separates staff working on “iconic sites” that usually charge a per-person fee, such as Cleland Wildlife Park, Naracoorte Caves and Seal Bay; and staff working on sites that usually have no fee, or a vehicle entry fee, such as Flinders Chase National Park, Flinders Ranges National Park or Belair National Park. The reviews available were cross referenced against a list of priority parks that DEW has identified through the parks characterisation project to ensure that reviews were captured for all significant non-iconic sites. The web scraping software Octoparse was used to capture the following elements for analysis: Reviewer name Reviewer location (country, state and city) Reviewer age Reviewer gender Review date Review title Review text Review star rating Note that the web scraping software was able to effectively capture elements such as name, date, title, text and star rating, but that capturing the demographic information about the reviewers was a more difficult process. The demographic information is contained within “hover over” elements of the Trip Advisor web pages. Code was written to scrape these elements for the initial data scrape; manual cutting and pasting was used for scrape updates. It may be for this reason that most academic analysis of Trip Advisor reviews does not extend to considering demographic information and that this report may offer some new information about the utility of this data source. Once the data was captured it was cleaned so that it could be imported into SPSS for quantitative analysis and Nvivo for qualitative analysis. The cleaning included: Ensuring that each review was attached to a unique reviewer name to allow for import into Nvivo. For example, where a reviewer had written reviews about more than one park, R1, R2, R3 and so on were added to their name: “AussieGirl R1”, “AussieGirl R2” etc. Standardising place names to ensure that spellings were correct. Allocating state and/or countries to reviewers who gave only partial location information such as city of residence. Ensuring that the data set contained no blank cells. Removing reviewers under 18 years old (Age field equal to ‘13-18’). "],

For example, 1714 (45%) reviews did not provide their gender and 1987 (52%) didn’t provide their age. Figure 3.1 shows the percentage of reviews that did not provide information against each field. Figure 3.1: A large proportion of reviews did not answer some questions, particularly Gender and Age 3.3 Count of reviews There are several variables in the data with relatively few levels: Age; City; Country; Gender; id; Month; Park; reviews; Stars; State; User; and Year.

The analysis was run using the rstanarm package (Stan Development Team 2016) in R (R Core Team 2019). Month (of review), Park (visited by reviewer) and State (of origin of reviewer) were treated as random effects in the analysis. Each reviewer was then assumed to provide an independent data point for the analysis. A time field was generated as \\(time = min(Year) + (max(Year) - min(Year))/2\\). The model specification was: cbind(Y, 4 - Y) ~ Gender * Age * time + (1 | Month) + (1 | Park) + , (1 | State) where Y is Stars-1. 4.2 Model diagnostics Figure 4.1 shows that each of the chains used to estimate model parameters converged around similar values for each parameter.

["word-analysis.html", "7 Word analysis 7.1 Overall sentiment 7.2 By park sentiment 7.3 Activities", " 7 Word analysis 7.1 Overall sentiment Using the tidytext package (Robinson and Silge 2018), the text within the character fields Title and Review were analysed. Some words were replaced with a synonym (Appendix Table 9.1). This includes ‘lumping’ words such as, say, echidna into wildlife. The following words were reclassified as neutral from negative sentiment as they were overwhelmingly not used in a negative manner: cave; challenging; cold; crashing; desert; dirt; downhill; falls; miss; remarkable; rocky; ruins; shady; steep; unbelievable; unexpected; unusual; wedge; and wild. The following words were removed from the analysis as they refer to park names and therefore occur frequently: adelaide; arch; chase; coffin; coober; flinders; fur; granite; gully; harbor; harbour; island; kangaroo; ki; lofty; morialta; mount; mt; national; park; pedy; pound; ranges; rocks; victor; and wilpena. Figure 7.1 shows the ten most common positive, negative and neutral words given in the Title field. The presence of worth in this list suggested that reviewers thought that the positive sentiments they expressed came at a cost (perhaps time and/or distance). A random sample of contexts in which worth occured: Worth the Drive “Well worth the visit” “Worth the drive” Worth every kilometre of bumpy road “Well worth the visit” Figure 7.2 shows the ten most common positive, negative and neutral words given in the Review field. Again, the most frequently occuring words are positive or neutral. Also, worth occurs frequently again, but so does easy. A random sample of contexts in which easy occured: We travelled in June and it was chilly. The Park rangers at the station friendly they have an impressive headquarters The remarkable rocks are just that and Admiral’s Arch and the seal colony was very interesting reasonable easy to access plenty of seals. Remarkable rocks and Admirals Arch are absolutely enthralling. The path to Admirals Arch is easy to walk and well maintained. Plenty of seals. While this park is at the far end of the island it also has some of the best attractions on the island. It is mostly bush with unsealed roads through it and you can expect to see some wildlife such as kangaroos. The roads are good as long as it isn’t wet and are well-maintained. The two attractions at the end of the island, the Remarkable Rocks and the Admirals Arch are both natural attractions that are easy to get to and we found the both to be very interesting. There is an entrance fee which you pay at the park headquarters near the entrance to the park. There is a lot of valuable information available at the park headquarters also. The waterfall is a nice getaway from the city life. Came with 2 young kids and the waterfall is easy to access from Adelaide City. Car park is at close proximity as well. There’s a short path to reach the top of the waterfall from the base which is easy to walk, but too rocky for strollers. This place is a little of the beaten track but well worth a visit you drive along unsealed roads from streaky bay following the seal signs it is well sign posted the roads are well graded so no worries there. When you park your car you have a 250 short walk to the lookout I can not walk far but it was easy for me. ,When you get to the wooden lookout you can see all the seals below basking in the sun or frolicking in the water or rolling around in the sand and when we were there lots of babies were with there mums. It’s a good idea to have some binoculars with you so get a real good look Figure 7.1: Titles had words with positive sentiment much more frequently than words with negative sentiment Figure 7.2: Reviews used words with positive sentiment more frequently than words with negative sentiment 7.2 By park sentiment Figure 7.3 shows, by park, the five most common positive, negative and neutral words given in the Title field. The lowest frequency at which nature occurs is third. A random sample of contexts in which nature occurs: Enjoyable nature walk “So many things to see &amp; walks to do - Aussie nature at its best…” “Absolute nature” “A place to feel and see the magic of nature &amp; experience wonderment” “A place to feel and see the magic of nature &amp; experience wonderment” Figure 7.4 shows, by park, the five most common positive, negative and neutral words given in the Review field. Each park had hard in the negative words, followed by difficult which occured in most parks. Some examples of the context in which hard occurs: This walk is so beautiful and you have a couple of tracks to choose from depending on whether you want a faster or more intense walk/run. I love walking the track straight to the lighthouse, stopping for a drink and some beautiful views and fresh air before heading back down to the waterfall. I find the straight walk there and back hard enough! (Though some reviewers would probably laugh at me lol) the incline is steady but consistent the whole way up! I know some people that do up and down running in under an hour. So this walk is perfect for all people looking for whatever type of walk or workout your prefer. If your elderly or have difficulty breathing/leg injuries etc. I’d give this one a miss. Once you get up there’s only 1 day down and I’d. Ever recommend my nan or grandad try this walk for he scenic value. If your a but older and looking to enjoy waterfall gully, go to the bottom for your photos then drive up to the lighthouse and meet your friends or family up there for a pelt view or some lunch in the restaurant :) If you walk during wetter times of the year this trek is also heaps of fun to get a bit dirtier and see the other few waterfalls looking spectacular. Don’t forget to bring your camera and take some photos at the bottom and along the way :) Also, if your looking for other activities around the area, try cuddly creek, Gorge wildlife park, the big rocking horse, chocolate factory as well :-) Lovely day out for the family exploring the stunning landscape and waterfall. It would be hard for someone of low fitness to make it to the top but a nice day out regardless. If your feeling fit please put your walking shoe’s on take a bottle of water and go for a walk Autumn is the best time because it’s beautiful and green and if any rain has fallen the waterfall is magnificent it’s a hard walk so be prepared for your heart to go up.Very enjoyable Figure 7.3: Top ten words in the title text for each sentiment class (positive, negative and neutral) for the parks with the most reviews Figure 7.4: Top ten words in the review text for each sentiment class (positive, negative and neutral) for the parks with the most reviews 7.3 Activities Figure 7.5 shows how frequently various activities were mentioned in the Review field. This information is essentially the same as in Figure 7.2 but with a focus only on activities. Figure 7.6 shows the frequency with which activities are mentioned in the Review field for the most reviewed parks. Often reviewers mention things done outside the park in their reviews. For example, the reviews for Granite Island that mentioned camping gave lots of information about the area around that park: We had initially been disappointed to find out that the penguin population was so small that we wouldn’t be able to see any, but decided to visit the Island anyways. We enjoyed our stroll and the cool granite structures. Our favourite part of visiting Victor Harbour was the hike up the Bluffs and then along the Petrol Cove Path. We spent the night camping in Waitpinga and that was our highlight of the trip. The beach was amazing and so was the hike along the Heysen Trail. We’d strongly advise anyone visiting this area to include some of these bush walks in their visit and next time we go back we’d take more time to do more of this Victor Harbour and the Fleurieu Peninsula. Victor Harbor is situated approx 80kms south of Adelaide, the drive takes around 80 minutes depending whether you want to stop at Mclaren Valley. We stayed at the Whalers Inn situated just on the outskirts of Victor Harbor. (Read review) and had all intentions of visiting Kangaroo Island. What is amazing about this area is the huge diversity of landscapes and attractions, which can cause a deviation or detour from your original itinerary. Hence, we never got to see Kangaroo Island, as we found the whole region of the Fleurieu Peninsula absolutely fascinating, stunning and spectacular with dramatic scenery. The natural wilderness mixed with pristine rugged coastline and beaches, truly makes this region Australia’s best natural asset. Victor Harbor is nestled by the sea, with lovely colonial heritage buildings and sites. The town is very quaint with some great old Australian pubs and Inns. There are plenty of restaurants, cafes and shops to keep you entertained. You can take a Heritage walking trial tour and learn the history of buildings like the Old Custom and Stationmaster house. The best thing to do is walk across or catch the horse-drawn wagon across to Granite Island and see the colony of little penguins. The best time to see the penguins is in the early evening around 7pm, as the penguins return home from sea to feed their chicks. (Make sure you take some warm clothes, it…Victor Harbour and the Fleurieu Peninsula.

Victor Harbour is a lovely seaside town and far more appealing and interesting; Whaler’s Inn is approx 30 minutes drive away from Cape Jervis and a far better choice to be positioned. What to do: Walk across to Granite Island and see the penguins at dusk. Visit the towns of Goolwa, Port Elliot, Hindmarsh Island, and Coorong National Park and see the Murray River Mouth. For some awesome scenery take a walk on the “Heysen Trail” which can be connected to just past the Bluff or at Parsons beach or Newland Headlands.(A must do). You can walk this track to Cape Jervis but it takes a couple of days, camping areas are available for keen bushwalkers. Another walk is from Victor Harbor to Port Elliot along the beach. (7kms). All maps can be obtained at the Information Centre. Follow all the tourist brown signs and get lost in the beauty exploring this gorgeous region. From Cape Jervis drive the coastal road back to Adelaide and see some lovely seaside towns.

There is very little effect of age and gender on stars. 18-24 year old males had the lowest mean credible estimate for stars but this was still a relatively healthy 3.62 stars. 8.1.2 What is the effect of the park visited on the rating given? There is little effect of park on the rating given. In the last year there was only 0.52 stars difference between the maximum and minimum mean credible estimate for stars given to parks in the dataset. This is only 10.4% of the possible range of 1 to 5. 8.1.3 What is the effect of the origin of a reviewer on the rating given? There is very little effect of the origin of a reviewer on the rating given. In the last year, there was only 0.4 stars or 8% of the possible difference. 8.1.4 Summary The TripAdvisor data has little resolution in stars given for the attributes available for analysis. Most reviewers give South Australian DEW managed parks very good reviews - roughly 4.5 stars on average. 8.2 Words used in reviews As for the stars analysis, the word analysis showed overwhelmingly positive words were used to describe both overall parks (Figures 7.1 &amp; 7.2) or for specific parks (Figures 7.3 &amp; 7.4). Reviewers most frequently mention nature; walk; and wildlife in their reviews along with positive words such as amazing; beautiful; easy; enjoy; and worth. "],
