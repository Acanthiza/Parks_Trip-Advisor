For example, 1714 (45%) reviews did not provide their gender and 1987 (52%) didnâ€™t provide their age. Figure 1.1 shows the percentage of reviews that did not provide information against each field. Figure 1.1: A large proportion of reviews did not answer some questions, particularly Gender and Age 1.3 Count of reviews There are several variables in the data with relatively few levels: Age; City; Country; Gender; Month; Park; Stars; State; User; and Year. Figure 1.2 shows the most frequently occuring values in each of those variables. Figure 1.2: Most frequent values in each of the variables. Most reviews are from Adelaide based 50-64 year olds called Charmaine who visit Flinders Chase in January "],
["overall-analysis.html", "2 Overall analysis 2.1 Model 2.2 Model diagnostics 2.3 Model predictions", " 2 Overall analysis 2.1 Model Trend through time (year) in stars given by age and gender of reviewers (and the interaction of age, gender and time) was analysed using a Bayesian binomial generalised linear mixed model. The analysis was run using the rstanarm package (Stan Development Team 2016) in R (R Core Team 2018). Month (of review), Park (visited by reviewer) and State (of origin of reviewer) were treated as random effects in the analysis. Each reviewer was then assumed to provide an independent data point for the analysis. A time field was generated as \\(time = min(Year) + (max(Year) - min(Year))/2\\). The model specification was: cbind(Y, 4 - Y) ~ Gender * Age * time + (1 | Month) + (1 | Park) + , (1 | State) where Y is Stars-1. 2.2 Model diagnostics Figure 2.1 shows that each of the chains used to estimate model parameters converged around similar values for each parameter. Figure 2.1: All chains converged around the same values for each of the model paramaters (first 10 shown here) Figure 2.2 provides further support for convergence of the chains as no values are markedly different to 1.0. Figure 2.2: Rhat values show no reason for concern Figure 2.3 shows how (a sample of) the model runs (in light blue) compare with the original data (shown in dark blue). Figure 2.3: The model runs under estimate four stars and over estimate three stars relative to the data Figure 2.4 shows how the mean and standard deviation of the model runs (in light blue) compare with that of the original data (in dark blue). Figure 2.4: Collectively the model runs do a reasonable job estimating the data 2.3 Model predictions In order to better understand how the data and resulting model are able to inform management, a number (4000) of simulations were made based on the model results (strictly, draws were made from the posterior predictive distribution). Each simulation generated a prediction based on a single draw of the model parameters from their predicted distributions. Table 2.1 shows a summary of these results.

Overwhelmingly, reviewers give 5 stars, irrespective of age or gender. Figure 2.5: Model results. Most reviewers give 5 stars irrespective of age or gender. The lower 95% credible intervals go to three stars in almost every case - i.e. more than 95% of responses are three stars or more. Older males (65+ years old) - only in 2013 and 2014 were they most likely to give 5 stars References "],
